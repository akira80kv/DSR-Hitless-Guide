# DS1R No Hit

---

by Akira80kv, Huge thanks to Carlo and other runners for clearing up info & giving suggestions!

Inspired by Carlo’s guide:

# Useful Tech

- When running, holding block will fasten the sprint start up animation. It also changes the hitbox of your player and will sometimes make you get hit! Use it carefully :)
- Every time when falling, switching weapons mid air, and quickly pressing your dodge button once cancels the fall animation when you hit the floor!

## Tools

Here are both the black knight jump and duke skip, as well as most bosses:

## Character Creation

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled.png)

Thief, Black Firebomb

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%201.png)

At the ladder, take the time to sort everything out!

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%202.png)

Stand at more or less this spot in the floor, and throw 2 BF, dodge the attack, throw 2 more, and one more to kill him. You must only miss 1 BF Max, or you won’t have enough BFs later.

After getting flasks, open door and leave.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%203.png)

At firelink, grab the humanities, down the elevator hole, grab homeward bones and loyd talisman, and bone out.

## Dragons & Grass Crest Shield

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%204.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%205.png)

Run on top of this broken wall here, VERY IMPORTANT for RTSR

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%206.png)

Jump here, and when youre on top of the broken wall switch weapons like mentioned before.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%207.png)

Now, pick up the soul behind the door, and go forward.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%208.png)

Now grab the soul behind the door and the one at the dragon claw, and keep going forward. Once at the first dragon, hug right wall and roll to his left. Alternatively, if you look at his head, if he doesnt move it much go right, if he wobbles it go left.

At the bridge hug right wall and then go left.

Do a zigzag pattern, aggroing all 3 dragons, and go up the tower. Grab RTSR, and roll down, at the floor, spam roll 3 times and run over to the elevator over to darkroot forest.

Take the time in the elevator to use your souls.

Aggro the black knight, and walk back in the cave, once he starts walking back youre free to run past. Now, jump at the edge of the plant on the ground and without using the left joystick spam right trigger so you plunge attack. Walk to the edge and the BK should fall.

(note that if you get the halverd you can still do the normal route shown for crystal halverd, but you can also change the boss order and go for Sif earlier, etc)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%209.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2010.png)

Sprint against the wall and jump, grab grass shield.

Up ahead grab the bow, and further up kill the lizard with a BFB and an r1.

## Undead Parish
At undead parish first time buy:

6 titanites, axe, upgrade to +4

Kill the first 3 enemies, and strafe the big sentinel guy to his right, and hit his back 2 to 3 times with +4 axe.

Now, stand here and kill with your bow the magic enemy and the 2 undeads. Shooting at the sword of the one on the right kills it. Then open the shortcut elevator and come back.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2011.png)

Up the stairs, BFB the knight and go up.

Stand next to this bench

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2012.png)

Aim around here, normally I use the texture in the wall + the actual crosshair, so just take a look at the image, and throw a BFB.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2013.png)

Then, you can either shoot the next guy, or run past him.

At gargoyles, note you should have RTSR. Go to the right of the ceiling, and strafe the first gargoyle's hit. Ideally, cut his tale. Every 2 hits he should be stunned and die fairly easy. The second gargoyle will probably do the fire attack. R2 + R1 kills it.

Ring the bell and homeward bone out, returning to firelink. Level STR to 20.

## Blighttown
This time don't go on the wall, just down the stairs. Kick lautrec through the window, and quit out to get the FAP ring. Now, go to the elevator again, after elevator, using the humanities at the elevator, you should have 11. Doing the wall jump, go to blighttown!! Woohooo!!

Stand in this log, and walk slowly towards the edge. When you start falling down the slope quickly, immediately spam roll and keep the joystick to the left. 

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2014.png)

Stand next to this ladder and target the dart enemy, walk away from the ladder and BFB him to get a moss.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2015.png)

Drop down to the wheel, heal up, and calculate the jump so you get around half hp. Then, jump here again. Go to queelag, and at RTSR range cure the poison.

Tips for queelag:

- Staying at the left of the spiders head will prevent you from taking damage when she does the swings, roll just in case if you want, but its fairly safe, you can get a couple hits off.
- Hit like 2 to 3 times when she spews lava.

Those 2 are the biggest punishes vs her.

- Always ready to react to her nuke. She starts hugging the spider and curling a little.

Practice with Saves!!

Use her soul

Heal up and down the hole, and go to ceaseless. Straightforward, just run and hit him with your fist.

## Sen's
Homeward bone, take the elevator to undead parish, and level both axe and bow to +5, and buy 135 arrows or so.

Go up sens. You have to go fairly quickly, roll the lightning bolt the snake throws, and through the fog. Then, go fast up the stairs and fall down at this spot:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2016.png)

Then go through normal. Here, keep running through WITHOUT THE SHIELD ON

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2017.png)

Here, punch this guy with the fist and keep running.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2018.png)

Grab the soul and down to the bonfire, and level up STR 27 dex 20.

Go back down the stairs and wait for him to shoot at the pillar, then hit him off the ledge.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2019.png)

Go down the hole at the end of the hallway.

Shoot here and stand right at the door, then drop down.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2020.png)

Stand here at the corner and grab the ring, then, homeward bone.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2021.png)

Go up to the broken bridge, where you have to do the jump and buy from the NPC around 6 green blossoms and 5-6 BFBs After this go back and fall here: (note that if you fail the jump you have to bone back)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2022.png)

Fall to the same place twice, so you get RTSR. If you need a little bit less hp, drop down to here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2023.png)

Head up, and at the stairs wait until the undead shoots, run and kill him.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2024.png)

After this, break the boulders and kill the giant with arrows.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2025.png)

Stand on the left side of the golem at the start, running at him. 

Then, hit his right ankle, the one on your left, twice. He will stagger. Hit him a couple more times with R2s when hes in the floor. Use his soul when you kill him and go to anor londo.

## Anor Londo
Here, shoot the mimic after going past the elevator, to around the 4th tile:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2026.png)

Line up like this, with your head around the arch, and when hes close, throw a lloyds talisman and grab halberd if you don't have BKH.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2027.png)

Rest at the bonfire, and level dex to 28, and level halberd to +2

Go to the elevator and roll after you see 2 of these rings in the wall.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2028.png)

For the rest of the hp for RTSR, jump here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2029.png)

Go down and over to the “ceiling” level, and stand here to kill one that drops.

Shoot the guy on the right on the head

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2030.png)

Shoot at this part of the ceiling so one falls

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2031.png)

Up the ladder, stand here

Kill the last 2

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2032.png)

Run to the left of this:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2033.png)

At the elevator, go on top of the railing like so

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2034.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2035.png)

Kill the gargoyle and turn on the elevator.

Up the stairs, stop at around the fifth stair or so from the right, like so, and shoot the giant.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2036.png)

Jump and plunge attack from this railing.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2037.png)

Shoot here, and kill the 2 enemies down that will be stuck.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2038.png)

At this pillar, wait untill the right BK’s arrow hits the wall and start running.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2039.png)

Once you get here, wait and run as soon as he shoots and hug the wall, dodge arrow if necessary.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2040.png)

Once you kill the BK, make sure you have his much HP - around more than 2 bars

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2041.png)

Walk over to this spot, and shoot at the wall.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2042.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2043.png)

Unequip RTSR and equip Dragon ring, backstab the BK.

Up the stairs, jump over this part of the railing to get to O&S. Once up the stairs take one blossom.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2044.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2045.png)

Run down and around the left of the pillar, normally the giant won't do anything. If hes very close maybe safety roll.

Go through this part of the fog and immediately roll and stand about here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2046.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2047.png)

Some things might happen. Ideally, Ornstein will do his charged attack. You can just walk to the right to make him miss and hit him once. Any other attack roll and R1. Make sure smough is always behind the pillar, 3 hits kills him.

During second phase go to this pillar and be parallel to Smough. When he does his overhead jump attack, run hit him and go back behind the pillar. Use his soul.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2048.png)

Kill her with an arrow

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2049.png)

## Catacombs
Level dex to 35 and warp to firelink, place the lordvessel. Then, warp back to firelink and run to the catacombs. Bait this guy back to the staircase and kill him.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2050.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2051.png)

Hug this wall and hit it, you should kill the skeleton on the other side

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2052.png)

Drop down and to the left, kill the pyro and rest. Then, stand around here to kill the other pyro.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2053.png)

Stand in this spot and when the skelly is falling, dodge just in case, then shoot the other two and same thing. If you stand here, they will fall.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2054.png)

Then you want to JUMP here, changing your right weapon midair and pressing the run button fast, as mentioned before. Do this to drop down here. Then, look back to be able to target the wheel enemy and throw a BFB.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2055.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2056.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2057.png)

Next up, go over to pinwheel and run R1 him, and follow with another R1 to kill him. Immediately start spamming roll to dodge the clone. Heal up.

Then, go up the stairs and over to this prism stone, where you go straight to the one in the distance as shown in the photo.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2058.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2059.png)

After going to the other stone, hug the right wall past the skeleton and WALK (no run no slow walk, just walk) between this stone and the object on the right, like so, and then immediately roll to the right and grab the humanity:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2060.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2061.png)

Then drop down and to the direction of the lava you should see the bonfire:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2062.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2063.png)

Immediately rest and head up the stairs, now, go to patches, as shown:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2064.png)

Hug the left wall after going up the stairs and dont talk to him, trigger the cutscene, grab the 3 items and bone out. At the bonfire use the souls and get 37 dex.

## Fog Ring
Warp to firelink and at the shortcut elevator for undead parish, drop down and over to this pillar:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2065.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2066.png)

Drop down to the pillar by rolling, then up the stairs to get to the nest. Once you get teleported immediately go left and drop down. INSIDE the nest you see drop your lantern, quit out to get the fog ring.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2067.png)

## Duke's Archives
Equip the ring of fog where the FAP ring is. Bone out and travel to Anor Londo. Follow the stairs up where you got the halberd by the mimic, until you get to the duke’s archives. Stand at more or less the 4th pillar and shoot here WITHOUT the dragon ring:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2068.png)

Equip the dragon ring again and then run over to the elevator. (Hug the right wall when turning left through this hall) At the elevator take off your fog ring and when the melee guy starts walking up a bit, equip it back and run.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2069.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2070.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2071.png)

The archer at the left can be passed through his left, get to the elevator and immediately turn it on.

## Duke Skip:

- At the top, turn lever on again, immediately center camera with right camera joystick button, and also immediately start aiming your bow like so:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2072.png)

- While the animation is playing IMMEDIATELY roll once right, then once forward and once back, WITHOUT PAUSING. You should land on the railing. Still aiming, place the Arrow box UI at the bottom left like so on the wall:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2073.png)

When going down, the moment you pass the first floor roll forward and you should land in the railing. For more info look up duke skip on youtube!

Kill this guy and down the stairs, stand here for a second and then go down.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2074.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2075.png)

Immediately go to the next room to the right and heal up.

Pull the lever and with both rings do this:

Stand here first:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2076.png)

Midair, stun cancel, go through the fog and really quickly jump here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2077.png)

Then a bit further up jump here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2078.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2079.png)

After jumping off from this spot, go to the right of this crystal golem and a bit further up drop off here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2080.png)

After falling go to the right and across the first bridge.

Dodge this guy by running or rolling, depending on what he does:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2081.png)

And drop down here, crossing the bridge.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2082.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2083.png)

WITH BOTH RINGS ON hug the wall to the left and then walk over to this spot:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2084.png)

Switch dragon ring for the RTSR ring and run by hugging a bit the left wall and passing the last clamp on his left/our right. After the cutscene, with your bow, press S on your keyboard and DONT MOVE (Note Seath won’t actually be like this in the actual game)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2086.png)

Wait a bit and when Seath is closer to you, shoot an arrow straight. Should break the crystal. Run attack seath while hugging his right side, like so:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2087.png)

After the run attack, recover stamina and hit him 3 times. Recover stamina again and hit him 3 more times. Scripted Seath!

## Nito
At the bonfire, Dex 40 and Endurance 11. Then warp to tomb of the giants.

Back at patches, talk to him and say no to get 1 twin humanity

To his right, hug the wall and run over to the fog wall:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2088.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2089.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2090.png)

Go on a curved-ish line to the left after the fog, and once youre on the bridge shown on top go straight to the item:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2091.png)

Now roll over to the item twice, so you fall down to this platform:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2092.png)

now go to the path on the left of this skeleton

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2093.png)

Head over to the item and drop off the ledge to here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2094.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2095.png)

There, run and jump while hugging right wall. Go to the cave shown in the picture after dropping and RUN through, dodging any enemies in the path to their right and in between the 2 gians skeletons:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2096.png)

here drop down to the left and grab the item:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2097.png)

After that, head straight to the fog wall and heal up. Do a run and jump slightly right:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2098.png)

After the cutscene DONT MOVE and HOLD L1 WITH HALVERD. If Nito ever puts his hand up and is going to do the underground sword attack, if you dont move and hold block it will miss, even if it looks like it doesn’t. Stand still untill nito crosses this line:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%2099.png)

Once hes here, strafe most of his attacks and do MAX 3 r1s at a time. Pretty easy, whenever he curls and is going to do his nuke, just run here and wait behind the wall like so, then come back and kill him:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20100.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20101.png)

## Sif
After the fight bone out and warp to undead parish, use your souls and level up endurance until you are left with 20k souls for the crest. Buy it from andre.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20102.png)

Head over there, running to the right of the tree guys, until you get to this spot. Here, run off, and go back up. Careful of aggroing the ray enemy that is there.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20103.png)

Kill the big tree, through the fog wall keep going up and open the door.

With both stealth rings, hug the cliff to the left until being with the white cat. Here, you can either join the covenant and get the cartwheel ring, or kill sif. IMO it is good to have the ring, but the strategy to get it is a bit dangerous. I’ll show the cartwheel ring:

After joining the covenant kick this guy off the cliff and quit out:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20104.png)

Grab the ring and run where the cat is, careful of the sword guy because you have to roll his attack.

Run across the bridge and jump here, stun cancel:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20105.png)

Go straight until you get here, jump and stun cancel:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20106.png)

Open the door and grab the ring behind the tombstone, then take a blossom and start the Sif fight:

Tips:

- He has 3 or so punishable attacks. When he is running at you and does his charge attack (He stops moving for a second and then runs at you), you can roll and hit him once, then roll/run back. He can also start a swing from your right and his left, you have to roll that one, he will follow up with another swing, after dodging that one you can hit him, and he will either do one more attack you can punish or just back off.
- After punishing be ready to dodge his jump back or any other attack like his uppercut.
- He can hit you with his paws when jumping and that counts as a hit!

## Ghost Town & 4 Kings
After killing him bone out, and use his soul. Endurance to 17. Then warp to firelink. Go down the elevator to the ghost town, use your humanities while going down to have 27 humanities. 

Break this and grab the transient curse, use it.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20107.png)

Cross the bridges and up the stairs, and stand here, RIGHT AFTER THE TILES ARE FIXED

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20108.png)

Run a bit forward to where the stain in the floor is or so, then walk back and kill with arrows the first ghost that shows up in the doorway. Then, shoot an arrow straight to the back wall to kill the ghost that is on the distance. Finally stand inside the doorway but don’t go in the room, walk back and wait untill a ghost shows up, kill it.

Run to the spiral staircase and through the fog on the right. Then keep going forward and stand in these stairs:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20109.png)

Shoot ingward in the head until he dies, then jump here while hugging the right wall:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20110.png)

Head right up the stairs and into the tower where the switch for the water level is. Heal up, and then fall down here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20111.png)

Go into the fog wall and walk down in this direction, to fall over to the platform:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20112.png)

You should have RTSR, equip it and the artorias ring. 

4 Kings Tips:

Punish almost every move, just roll and attack them. If the does the homing missile don’t dodge because it’s impossible. Just run as fast as you can and get close to the king and pray it doesn’t hit you..

## Bed of Chaos
Bone out and to undead parish, level endurance to 20 and use 4 humanities you have to get 31. Then, warp to firelink. Equip both stealth rings, go back all the way like done before in blighttown to get to the bell, then roll here and say YES to the egg guy, and rest at the bonfire where queelag’s sister is.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20113.png)

Join the covenant and give her 30 humanities to get the shortcut. Now either use no rings or both stealth rings.

Now go same path over to where ceaseless is, but instead of going through the bridge you turn left like so and drop down here: 

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20114.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20115.png)

Heal up and go over where the capra demon is, dodge his attack with a roll and keep going down the only path you can take until you get here, jump down and either stagger cancel or roll and leave AS FAST AS POSSIBLE so the worm does not hit you.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20116.png)

Down the stairs and over to the fog wall, turn right and don’t go through. At full HP jump down here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20117.png)

Straight, equip both stealth rings and open the shortcut, go up the stairs and unequip the halberd for the boss fight. Once you get here, hit the demon on the tail with your left hand in this part:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20118.png)

Go either right or left depending on where he turns.

Now go straight and up this:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20119.png)

Run past everything and to the fog wall and go down the slope. When youre at the boss run in a straight line and hug him until he stops moving, then stand at the 7th tile, here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20120.png)

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20121.png)

Aim here, at this spot, and pop a green blossom and throw a BFB. DON’T ZOOM IN.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20122.png)

After that BFB throw another one here, in your right side:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20123.png)

Immediately start rolling inside until your stamina is gone, and switch to your fist, then wait till stamina is back up and roll more, then kill the bug inside. After the fight warp to firelink. Place souls on the vessel and level endurance up to around 23.

## Kiln & Gwyn
At the kiln jump here:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20124.png)

And use this ledge as many times as you need to set up RTSR:

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20125.png)

Here go straight and after dropping down, WALK hugging the right wall and the knight shouldn’t aggro.

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20126.png)

Here change to RTSR and Hornet Ring

![Untitled](DS1R%20No%20Hit%20214cd1d64795462f95079ef33d2acf2e/Untitled%20127.png)

Go forward and walk once in a quick circle to aggro the knight and have a better position to run past him. Then just run to his left. Keep running down the stairs. Strafe the first knight to the left and the other knight to the right, and enter the fog. Roll once and lock on, walk forward and parry his first attack. Walk behind him and when he is fully stood up do 3 rolls, and walk back until he finishes his attack, then walk forward and parry again. Then, an R1 kills him.

You can also use a green blossom or consumables like egg fermifuge when hes at the floor to make him normally do the slow attack but its not 100%

GGs.
